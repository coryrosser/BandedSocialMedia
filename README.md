# BandedSocialMedia
Banded is a social media site I made with inspiration from other projects. The site will serve as a place for musicians to join and connect with other musicians in the community. Whether your goal is to share your music, link up with other musicians to jam together, or just find someone to chat with about music, Banded is your place to be!


This site is currently in progress. Some style elements will change and features will be added.

Upcoming: 
-Back-End support for account creation, posting, and interacting with posts.
-Support for video, sound and picture upload.
-Account creation for venues.
